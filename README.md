## Case: Stalker Ransom of Victim 
### Domain - Mobile Forensics
## Group members: 
- Joseph L. Senesie (Project Manager)
- Zamarah J. Salinas (Scribe)
- Michael J. Roller (Evidence Analyst)
## Case Objective: 
A Person is reporting that they are receviving fequent calls and texts from a unknown number and a unknown caller ID. Despite blocking the numbers, they continue to get calls and text messages demanding payment. The victam believes they are being stalked. The Stalker has threatened to leak sensitive personal information online.
Your forensic team has been able to collect the stalker phone for investigation. Provided is a Android 13 device image (sourced from digitalcorpora.org). The forensic team must identify evidence related to stalking, data collection, and extortion. 

## Key Foresics:
The primary goals of this investigation are: 
- Recover collected data that was deleted within trash folder.
- Discover list of contacts, call logs, and messages associated with the victam and stalker.  
- Analyze browser history and device image for protentionaly dangerous websites user have went. 
- Identify downloaded data, files, and metadata assosciated with victam.  
- Document all findings using proper forensic methodology, ensuring integrity and reproducibility. 

## Tools and evidances 
- Android 13 Device Image (digitalcorpora.org) 
    ## Hardware Tools
- Forensic workstation or laptop – isolated and secured environment 
- Write blockers – prevent alteration of data during acquisition
- SIM card readers – extract data directly from SIM cards.
- Cables and adapters
- JTAG extraction kits
    ## Software Tools
- Autopsy / sleuthkit - free tool for analyzing disk images and recovering files
- Cellebrite UFED / Physical Analyzer – industry standard for logical, file system, and physical extraction.
- Magnet AXIOM – performs acquisition and deep analysis of iOS and Android data.
- Oxygen Forensic Detective – offers broad device support and in-depth app data analysis.
- MSAB XRY – another professional-grade suite for extracting and analyzing data.

Note: Not all tools may be used—list actual tools used during analysis in your final report.
